Hostel room are below average food is available in the canteen and the hostel rooms are average.
Courses are completed before semester end internal exams are conducted on timely labs and classes are conducted regularly overall college is good for low fee and good study. Our teacher are very helpful in order to provide knowledge some of our teacher are very experienced and qualified semester exams are bit harder because you don't know from where the question is come some times max. Questions come from one chapters the passing percentage is above 40% .
I chose this course because like this course and explore my knowledge in the field of IT industry there are many clubs in our college, which keeps on organizing fests, and functions and all types of competition. Labs and classes and teachers should need improvement.
